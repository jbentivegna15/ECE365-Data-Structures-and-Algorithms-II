## Projects
1. hash table and spell checker - This project involved the creation of a hash table and implementing it into a spell checker program. The spellchecker takes an input file and determines if a word is spelled correctly by recalling words from a dictionary inserted into the hash table.

2. binary heap - In this project a priority queue was created using a binary heap implementation. The heap relied on the hash table created in the previous project for quick insertions. The user can specify a heap capacity and functionality was created for insersion, deletion, delete-min, and set-key.

3. Dijkstra's algorithm - This project used the previously build hash table and binary heap to implement Dijkstra's algorithm to solve the single-source shortest-path problem.  The program prompts the user for the name of a file specifying the graph.  Then, given a starting vertex, it will find the shortest path to each other vertex in the graph.
